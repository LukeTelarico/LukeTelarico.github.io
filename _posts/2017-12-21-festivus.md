Officially Dec. 23, Festivus is an alternative holiday celebration for 
those who dislike the commercialization of more commonly celebrated holidays.

<p>What is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HX55AzGku5Y">Festivus</a>? According to legend, Festivus founder Frank Costanza, was looking for a doll to give his son George for Christmas. He found himself in a brawl with another customer attempting to get the only doll in stock. In typical Frank fashion, he was determined to find a creative solution to his problem. Something simple, like buying presents before the last minute, would never cross his mind. </p>
<p>So Frank created Festivus, a holiday for the rest of us. Instead of presents and a Christmas tree, there is an aluminum pole. The main activities involved in this activity are gathering for dinner, at which point everyone can air their grievances. After this, you move into the feats of strength, which typically includes a wrestling match. Unlike baseball, crying is quite common amongst losing contestants. </p>
<p>This holiday seems perfect for millennials, like myself, who take pleasure in airing their grievances and competing in the feats of strength. We also don’t have much money, so not having to buy presents or decorate add to the appeal. Wouldn’t it be great to sit down at the table and be allowed to yell, “I got a lot of problems with you people!” and “you suck!” at whomever you are with, free of consequences. This is almost like a passive-aggressive version of the purge!</p>
<p>While some of you may be opposed to celebrating Festivus exclusively, I would recommend making some time for it between the binge-drinking and Office marathons. Gather everyone up around your aluminum pole and really get into the spirit of the holiday. And be sure to watch out for Festivus miracles! (Miracles can be any kind of coincidence, and quantity is more important than quality)</p>
<p>Happy Festivus</p>
