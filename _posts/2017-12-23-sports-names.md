title: Deciding the Best Names in Sports!
---

We go through five different categories to systematically declare a winner for best name amongst some of my personal favorites.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/name_medium.jpg)

<p>An elaborate method of scoring my favorite sports names, and declaring a winner. The contestants: Yangervis Solarte, Dikembe Mutombo, Rusty Kuntz, Hampus Lindholm, Nomar Garciaparra, and Dick Butkus. These players will be evaluate based on the following criteria: How the name rolls off the tongue, if the name sounds similar to a random word, how creative the name is, how much fear the name can impose on the opposition, and general talent of the player, which helps the name gain notoriety.</p>

<table>So we begin with “How the name rolls off the tongue”. All of these categories are pretty subjective, but this one is definitely very biased.
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yangervis Solarte</td><td>2 points</td><td>Solarte is fine, but yangervis is quite a handful.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dikembe Mutombo</td><td>9 points</td><td>I love saying this name. It’s as simple as that.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty Kuntz</td><td>4 points</td><td>Nothing to see here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hampus Lindholm</td><td>6 points</td><td>Four syllables, and it flows moderately well.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nomar Garciaparra</td><td>10 points</td><td>He is the real winner here with his beautiful last name.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dick Butkus</td><td>5 points</td><td>As far as flow, it seems kind of average.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>The next category here is “similarity to a random word”. It has to be a word or phrase that immediately jumps out at you. I am not trying to dig through the dictionary to find a connection.
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yangervis Solarte</td><td>4 points</td><td>When I hear his name, I don’t draw any parallels to a real word or image. But if you read it and say it incorrectly, you can come close to jaeger.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dikembe Mutombo</td><td>1 points</td><td>All I think of is his name. That might normally be good, but not in this contest.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty Kuntz</td><td>9 points</td><td>Double whammy with this guy. It’s a little too obvious here, but minus one point for being inappropriate.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hampus Lindholm</td><td>8 points</td><td>Merry Hampus everyone! There is also <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krampus>Krampus</a>, both holiday themed.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nomar Garciaparra</td><td>6 points</td><td>It kinda sounds like “no more”.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dick Butkus</td><td>8 points</td><td>Also very obvious, and with two points penalties.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>Creativity is our third category. If your first name is in the dictionary, you won’t get points here. You also don’t get points for a basic name, like Chris. And remember, they play in America, so foreign names gain an advantage.
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yangervis Solarte</td><td>9 points</td><td>It is actually a combination of his parent’s names, Yanmili and Gervis. Who would think to turn a couple name into a child name? Pretty creative if you ask me.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dikembe Mutombo</td><td>8 points</td><td>I'm not actually sure how common Dikembe is in the Congo, but no one has it here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty Kuntz</td><td>1 points</td><td>Rusty? At least make his name badass to make up for that last name you gifted him.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hampus Lindholm</td><td>4 points</td><td>I have to believe the name is pretty common in Sweden, but it isn’t here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nomar Garciaparra</td><td>10 points</td><td>What’s even better than a couple name? The dad’s name, Ramon, backwards.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dick Butkus</td><td>2 points</td><td>I'm assuming that Dick is short for Richard, which is pretty basic in my opinion.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>Next we move onto the fear factor of the name itself. All of these names are pretty tame for the most part, so I will be looking for any tiny little things.
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yangervis Solarte</td><td>7 points</td><td>Going back to the incorrect jaeger connection, the drink can instill fear in at a party, and adding the bomb to the end can be used as a baseball pun. Weak argument in a weak category. Sue me.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dikembe Mutombo</td><td>10 points</td><td>I hear this name in a deep voice and picture a blocked shot and finger wag. If you named your kid Dikembe, now that would be pretty cool.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty Kuntz</td><td>1 points</td><td>I'm sorry, this kid is definitely getting beat up at school.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hampus Lindholm</td><td>4 points</td><td>Lindholm is a neat last name, but Hampus isn’t really gonna cut it in this category.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nomar Garciaparra</td><td>3 points</td><td>I’m assuming he got teased at the plate with “you can’t hit no more”. But that wasn’t really true until he was in his 30’s.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dick Butkus</td><td>2 points</td><td>Not sure where to go here, so I won’t hazard an explanation. Next category please.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<table>The final category here is general talent to promote notoriety. I will take awards and honors into consideration, more so than actual stats like WAR.
    <tr>
        <th>Name</th><th>Points</th><th>Reason</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Yangervis Solarte</td><td>3 points</td><td>Pretty much a Jose Ramirez lite. I hope he can take a stride forward with a healthy year and can escape the bottomless pit of San Diego’s garbage baseball system.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dikembe Mutombo</td><td>10 points</td><td>He was really good. He is in the NBA hall of fame, so he is an easy choice for the talent portion. Not only that, but his Geico commercial was also great.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Rusty Kuntz</td><td>1 points</td><td>His only claim to fame is a game-winning RBI in the 1984 World Series, but he collected negative WAR. His coaching career has never been as the man in charge either. Self-fulfilling prophecy here?</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Hampus Lindholm</td><td>4 points</td><td>I like watching him play for the Ducks, and he recently scored a hat trick. Age is also still on his side. This rating is the most likely to improve with time here.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Nomar Garciaparra</td><td>8 points</td><td>He made it onto the MLB hall of fame ballot, which is impressive by itself. He was also grouped in with Jeter and A-Rod as the next great wave of young shortstops. If only he hadn’t left Boston right before they broke the curse.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Dick Butkus</td><td>10 points</td><td>He made two all decade teams, the NFL hall of fame, and a lot of Pro Bowls. He is often used as the ideal for middle linebackers. Pretty great career.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>The pursuit for the best name here was actually a very close, two-man race. Nomar Garciaparra came very close to winning on the strength of sound and creativity. He scored a 37 out of a possible 50 points. But the winner here was Dikembe Mutombo with 38 points. The fear factor and hall of fame career will ensure that any kid who is named Dikembe will get to hear about Mutombo. Congratulations on winning the inaugural ridiculous scoring article! It is a very prestigious honor indeed. The other contestants scored the following number of points. Yangervis: 22, Rusty: 16, Hampus: 26, Butkus: 27.</p>
