### More Information

My hobbies include fantasy baseball, CSFBL, all kinds of rock music, and searching for good Mexican restaurants.

I have developed several excel tools for CSFBL. The one linked here uses a dynamic web query to pull a draft class from the game and manipulate the ratings into personalized scores. You must be logged on through excel, and do a little copy and pasting to get everything lined up correctly on the third tab. In the end though, the ratings can be sorted and have made my drafts very easy. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-RrX3q5ZhEFZ1hpOWotdU1yOHc">Dynamic Draft</a>
